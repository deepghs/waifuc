Understanding the Waifuc Workflow
=============================================================

Let's Make Some Donuts
-------------------------------------

This title might catch you off guard, but hold on a second. Imagine this scenario ‚Äî **you've got this fancy donut shop, and every now and then, customers with different taste preferences drop by to buy donuts. So, what should you do?**

The answer isn't that complicated. Simply put, it boils down to three things:

1. **Frying the Undecorated Donuts**: Before we start the process, we need to get some donuts with the base already fried.
2. **Customizing Based on Tastes**: Once we have the base, we need to coat it with different flavors of icing and add various toppings based on customer preferences.
3. **Packaging the Deliciousness**: After customization, you need to put the donuts into fancy little boxes, hand them over to the customers, wish them a pleasant meal, and have a great day.

For waifuc, it essentially involves the same three basic concepts ‚Äî Source, Action, and Exporter. In this process, the donuts correspond to your images, and the final packaged product is the dataset you use to train your sexy waifuüòç.
